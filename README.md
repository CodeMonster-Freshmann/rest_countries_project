## Overview

This project is the solution to rest countries api with color theme challenge on front-end mentor.
Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries V3 API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.
Rest countries api with color theme is a challenge project in which you should be able to do the following:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

You can check out for [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

### The Challenge

There are so many challenges I faced when I was building this project that I can't remember right now. But the major challenges I faced where adding the dark and light mode. Also the rest countries api was not written in a very accessible way so getting some contents from the api requires quite a number of logic. There is also another major challenge which is being able to get the border countries from the details page. This is because the borders of the countries in the api was not written in the borders' countries name but in their shortened form making it add to access

## The Process

The process I used was just to get all the countries from the ai to the home page using assynchronous javascript and then finding a way of being able to navigate to details page of each country

### Built with

This project was built using the javascript library React.
To learn more about react visit react page here... [React](https://reactjs.org)
And also tailwind css to do the styling part

### What I learned

I learnt how to initiate light mode and dark even though I didn't do it the standard way. Ib did it my way and it is working perfectly as expected just as doing it the standard ay will work. I learnt more things from this project than I could put down. You can also try the project to get thecreal feeling. Not compulsory to use React though, you can use any framework you confortable with or maybe even pure javascript.

### Useful Resources

The resources used was react basically but I had to download some other react dependencies like react-router-dom, react-icons and the likes. Oh just before I forget I also used tailwind css and sure my command line (laughs).
